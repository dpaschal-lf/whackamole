### find the mole

- Make X "mole" dom elements
  - a front dirt pile
  - a rear mole element
- Make the mole randomly pop up and down from behind the dirt (probably should use css transform: translate)
  - once the mole pops down, reset the ability to be clicked
- put a click handler on the mole.
  - once it is clicked, it scores a point and plays a sound
  - only one click counts.
